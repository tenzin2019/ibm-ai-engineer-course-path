Your task is to evaluate and select the best large language model (LLM) that can understand and follow complex instructions, improve the quality of automated customer service, and generate high-quality responses.\n","\n","However, simply choosing a powerful LLM isn't enough. To truly excel in these tasks, the model should be fine-tuned to align with specific goals and criteria. This is where reward models come into the picture. By training a reward model, you can guide the LLM to prioritize certain behaviors, ensuring it generates responses that not only meet technical standards but also align with the company's values and objectives.\n","\n","In this hands-on lab, you dive into the process of creating and training a reward model by using the transformer reinforcement learner (trl) library from Hugging Face. You learn how to set up the environment, define the rewards that shape the model's behavior, and fine-tune the LLM to perform with precision.
